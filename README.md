# Javascript Koans 

This repo is a fork of liammclennan/JavaScript-Koans.
We just added the possibility to run it using `node` and `npm` or `yarn`

### Quick start
**Make sure you have Node version >= 6.0 and NPM >= 3**
> Clone/Download the repo then edit `*.spec.js` files inside [`/test/`](/test/)

> Replace all `__` to fix failing test

```bash
# clone our repo
git clone https://github.com/hackages/javascript.koans.git

# change directory to our repo
cd javascript.koans

# start the server (`npm install` will be performed for you)
npm start

```
go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser

**We use Mocha in this repository**

**For those using `yarn`, make sure to remove the `prestart` script before running `yarn**

**For those using **WallabyJS**, just run it and you'll be on your way to master JS syntax**
